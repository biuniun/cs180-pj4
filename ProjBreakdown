Role 1: User Interface and Application Control Flow
Role 2: Account Management and User Permissions
Role 3: Messaging System and Core Features
Role 4: Additional Features and Testing

Classes and Interfaces:

User
Seller (extends User)
Customer (extends User)
Store
Message
Conversation
FileHandler (for import and export of messages)
Dashboard (for sellers and customers)
UserManager (for account creation, editing, and deletion)
StoreManager (for store creation and management)
MessagingManager (for managing messaging between users)
BlockingManager (for managing user blocking and invisibility)
Role 1: User Interface and Application Control Flow

Implement the main class that handles the user interface and application control flow.
Handle user input and output via System.in and System.out.
Coordinate with other roles to integrate their implementations with the user interface.
Role 2: Account Management and User Permissions

Implement the User, Seller, and Customer classes.
Implement the UserManager class for account creation, editing, and deletion.
Develop the user authentication and role-based permissions system.
Coordinate with other roles to integrate their implementations with the account management system.
Role 3: Messaging System and Core Features

Implement the Message, Conversation, and MessagingManager classes.
Develop the core messaging functionality and ensure appropriate access controls.
Implement the FileHandler class for importing and exporting messages in text and CSV format.
Coordinate with other roles to integrate their implementations with the messaging system.
Role 4: Additional Features and Testing

Implement the Dashboard class for sellers and customers.
Implement the Store, StoreManager, and BlockingManager classes.
Develop the optional features, such as new message notifications, message filtering, and disappearing conversations.
Develop test cases and perform testing to ensure the application works as expected.
Note that the implementation does not require separate server/client classes or interfaces, as the application is designed for single-user access. In case multi-user access is required in the future, the existing classes can be extended to include server/client functionality.

Breakdown of each class that needs to be implemented:

User
Attributes: email, password, role, conversations, blockedUsers
Methods: getEmail, getPassword, getRole, getConversations, getBlockedUsers, addConversation, blockUser, unblockUser, isBlocked
Seller (extends User)
Attributes: stores
Methods: createStore, getStores, getStoreById, removeStore, updateStore
Customer (extends User)
Attributes: (inherits attributes from User)
Methods: (inherits methods from User)
Store
Attributes: id, name, description, seller, messages
Methods: getId, getName, setDescription, getSeller, getMessages, addMessage, removeMessage, updateMessage
Message
Attributes: sender, recipient, timestamp, content
Methods: getSender, getRecipient, getTimestamp, getContent, setContent
Conversation
Attributes: participants, messages
Methods: getParticipants, getMessages, addMessage, removeMessage, updateMessage
FileHandler (for import and export of messages)
Methods: exportMessagesToCSV, importMessagesFromText
Dashboard (for sellers and customers)
Attributes: user
Methods: getSellerDashboard, getCustomerDashboard, sortDashboard
UserManager (for account creation, editing, and deletion)
Attributes: users
Methods: createUser, getUser, updateUser, deleteUser, authenticateUser
StoreManager (for store creation and management)
Attributes: stores
Methods: createStore, getStore, updateStore, deleteStore
MessagingManager (for managing messaging between users)
Attributes: conversations
Methods: createConversation, getConversation, updateConversation, deleteConversation, sendMessage, editMessage, deleteMessage
BlockingManager (for managing user blocking and invisibility)
Methods: blockUser, unblockUser, isBlocked, makeInvisible, makeVisible, isInvisible
Each of these classes should be designed with the Single Responsibility Principle in mind, ensuring that each class is responsible for a specific part of the functionality. This modular approach will make it easier to manage, maintain, and extend the codebase as needed.
